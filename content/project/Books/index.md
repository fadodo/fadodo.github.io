# Project Summary: What Drives Book Review Ratings?

In this project, I explored what really influences book review ratings—beyond the surface-level likes and word counts. Using NLP, sentiment analysis, and causal inference modeling, I analyzed thousands of reader reviews to see if factors like review length, sentiment, follower count, and likes actually predict star ratings.

Surprisingly, the data showed no strong causal link between these variables and the ratings themselves. Instead, the tone and content of the reviews revealed a deeper truth: 5-star reviews radiated joy and admiration, while 1-star ones were packed with frustration and confusion.

The takeaway? Star ratings may reflect more of a reviewer’s personal style than social signals. Sometimes, it’s not what you say—but how passionately (or dramatically) you say it.
